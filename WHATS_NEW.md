## 📊 Understanding Financial Health Score

Your Financial Health Score (0-100) is calculated based on:

**40% - Savings Rate**
- Higher savings = Better score
- Target: Save at least 20% of income

**40% - Budget Compliance**
- Staying within budgets = Better score
- Target: 100% compliance (no over-budget categories)

**20% - Having Active Income**
- Recording income = Better score

**Example:**
- Savings Rate: 25% → 40/40 points
- Budget Compliance: 90% → 36/40 points
- Has Income:Yes → 20/20 points
- **Total: 96/100** - Excellent! 🌟
